Group krenge document ka fir unme kuch find kren vale hai
pipeline ek ke bad dusra


// mongodb is having object id with itself which make all the documents unique it has no such problem 
of primary key , secondary key, candidate key

//mongodb is scalable

 it stores data either of the two method one is vertical scalable method and second is horizontal scalable method

 system design mai ek part hota hai scaling
 sharding: horizontal and vertical
 horizontal: we divide the physical memory into multiple sub memory
 vertical: we try to increase the physical memory

 *mostly used operators in aggregation pipeline

 $match == find, condition ko match krane k liye
 $Group : jab hume documents ki grouping krni hogi
 $projection : jab hume limited keys dikhani ho
 $unwind : jab hume array ko todna ho

 system design
 1. monolothic architecture
 2. distributive architecture
